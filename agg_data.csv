2018-02-09,Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage.

They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!....If a potential ‚Äúsicko shooter‚Äù knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won‚Äôt go there...problem solved. Must be offensive defense alone won‚Äôt work!I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families.

2018-03-12,Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law. Armed guards OK deterrent!...........On 18 to 21 Age Limits watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this but not much political support (to put it mildly).If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter.

We will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen!Sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP.

Children brought back to their country......Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama.

We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand.

Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well be cool. The end result will be worth it!Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year.

Vote for Keith!Harry Reid when he was sane agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship! https://t.co/ypiE1QWKagPaul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship something he knows nothing about!

2018-11-07,To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well....According to NBC News Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt led by 17 Angry Democrats is all about!In all fairness Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else at the Senate level. Two can play that game!I will be doing a news conference at The White House - 11:30 A.M. Will be discussing our success in the Midterms!Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out and hoping on Trade Deals.

2018-12-03,‚ÄúI will never testify against Trump.‚Äù This statement was recently made by Roger Stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Äù Nice to know that some people still have ‚Äúguts!‚ÄùCongratulations to newly inaugurated Mexican President @lopezobrador_.

The truth is very bad for their mission!....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence.China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also STOP THE DRUGS!I am certain that at some time in the future President Xi and I together with President Putin of Russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China. They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World and that is what China wants. Farmers I LOVE YOU!My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen.

Top Border Security including a Wall is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!The negotiations with China have already started. Unless extended they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina.

2018-12-07,Totally clears the President. Thank you!It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions.

Go for it Mitch!Mike Pompeo is doing a great job I am very proud of him. His predecessor Rex Tillerson didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity needed.

2018-12-21,General Anthony Tata author ‚ÄúDark Winter.‚Äù I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS.‚ÄùThe Democrats now own the shutdown!I‚Äôve done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents....not even close!Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America‚Äôs Southern Border! https://t.co/ws6LYhKcKlToday it was my honor to sign into law H.R. 7213 the ‚ÄúCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018.‚Äù The Act redesignates the @DHSgov Domestic Nuclear Detection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.Today it was my great honor to sign the #FirstStepAct - a monumental bi-partisan win for the American people! https://t.co/isy6Bt38iKThank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security! Have my total support.The Democrats whose votes we need in the Senate will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don‚Äôt want Open Borders and Crime!Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall or Fence and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done one way or the other!Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!House Republican Vote 217-185.No matter what happens today in the Senate Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes and we won big. I am very proud of you!.....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work and the Democrats are lying when they say they don‚Äôt. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else‚Äôs that will work and that has been true for thousands of years. It‚Äôs like the wheel there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone &amp; technology.....Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes but as shown in the House good things happen. If enough Dems don‚Äôt vote it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week live from the Oval Office that the Republicans didn‚Äôt have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all.

2018-12-24,I am in the Oval Office &amp; just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars &amp; lives will be saved!Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea ‚Äì Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim! https://t.co/zPTtDbrP0oI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria instead of the United States. See? Isn‚Äôt it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country the U.S. that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is without the Wall much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!I never ‚Äúlashed out‚Äù at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S. a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story one of many by the Fake News Media!AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &amp;  sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker.The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don‚Äôt have a feel for the Market they don‚Äôt understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can‚Äôt score because he has no touch - he can‚Äôt putt!To those few Senators who think I don‚Äôt like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong I DO. What I don‚Äôt like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States both in Military Protection and Trade...RT @RSScott_BP252: USBP Agents will continue to diligently do their sworn duites through the holidays and the furlough -JUST LIKE EVERY OTH‚Ä¶Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked that they turned against it. Desperately needed!President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus Turkey is right ‚Äúnext door.‚Äù Our troops are coming home!‚ÄúThe President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.‚Äù Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!The most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security and as EVERYONE knows you can‚Äôt have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones &amp; Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!Mitch McConnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best &amp; most productive of his career. Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts VA Choice Farm Bill Criminal Justice Reform Judgeships &amp; much more. Great!‚ÄúIt should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he‚Äôs right...The generals still don‚Äôt get the mistake.‚Äù  @RandPaul....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S. and our TAXPAYERS on Trade.

2018-12-31,It‚Äôs incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn‚Äôt work. It does and properly built almost 100%!

It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever they would still be unhappy!I campaigned on Border Security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an ‚ÄúOpen Wound‚Äù where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS remember!...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived like to complain about me &amp; my tactics which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President they would be a national hero.

Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!....Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing getting remains hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization...Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues.

Disgraceful!Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn‚Äôt work. Premiums &amp; deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it but with Medicare for all which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.....The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any ‚Äúplace‚Äù in history. The people of Puerto Rico.........back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime the USA is doing better than ever &amp; is respected again!....are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) &amp; deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive &amp; much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp; win......In 1998 Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report which the Dems hate he wants it all.

2019-05-14,Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas @TomCottonAR has just completed a wonderful book ‚ÄúSacred Duty‚Äù about Arlington National Cemetary and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion. On sale today make it big!With incredible grit skill and pride the 7000 workers here at Sempra Energy are helping lead the American Energy Revolution. They are not only making our nation WEALTHIER but they are making America SAFER by building a future of American Energy INDEPENDENCE! https://t.co/Hqn9wEIXo9It is great to be here in Hackberry Louisiana with the incredible men and women who are making America into the energy superpower of the world! https://t.co/l0DrjtHf62Today marks the one-year anniversary of the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem Israel. Our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with Israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth.When Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan visited with me in the @WhiteHouse two weeks ago I told him that I would be going to the G20 in Osaka Japan. I look forward to being with him and other World Leaders!Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas @TomCottonAR has just completed a wonderful book ‚ÄúSacred Duty‚Äù about Arlington National Cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion. On sale today make it big!China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‚Äúmatch‚Äù it would be game over we win! In any event China wants a deal!....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China and others to do business with us. The Farmers have been ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù for many years. Their time is now!When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but as I have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.........of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen and much faster than people think!We can make a deal with China tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.....Billions of Dollars and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don‚Äôt want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!....so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 Billion Dollars so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.....In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on ‚Äúdumped‚Äù steel from China &amp; other countries and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong!Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy......,-0.0015226364287435068,0.005679269310355561,0.006858904183232539,0.00904368416882173,-0.3950593327860288,255440.0,1199419.0,0.9994,0.024,0.766,0.211,our great senator (and star) from the state of arkansas @tomcottonar has just completed a wonderful book ‚Äúsacred duty‚Äù about arlington national cemetary and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion  on sale today make it big with incredible grit skill and pride the  workers here at sempra energy are helping lead the american energy revolution  they are not only making our nation wealthier but they are making america safer by building a future of american energy independence   is great to be here in hackberry louisiana with the incredible men and women who are making america into the energy superpower of the world   marks the one year anniversary of the opening of the united states embassy in jerusalem israel  our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth when prime minister @abeshinzo of japan visited with me in the @whitehouse two weeks ago i told him that i would be going to the g in osaka japan  i look forward to being with him and other world leaders our great senator (and star) from the state of arkansas @tomcottonar has just completed a wonderful book ‚Äúsacred duty‚Äù about arlington national cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion  on sale today make it big china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing  if the federal reserve ever did a ‚Äúmatch‚Äù it would be game over we win  in any event china wants a deal     this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us  the farmers have been ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù for many years  their time is now when the time is right we will make a deal with china  my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense  we have to be allowed to make up some         of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto  it will all happen and much faster than people think we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal  no way  we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made  will be taking in     billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong  other countries are already negotiating with us because they don‚Äôt want this to happen to them  they must be a part of usa action  this should have been done by our leaders many years ago  enjoy     so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers  we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great  election  we are the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of  no more china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost  billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position  make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff  you can also buy from a non tariffed country instead of china  many companies are leaving china     in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry   it is booming  we placed a % tariff on ‚Äúdumped‚Äù steel from china &amp; other countries and we now have a big and growing industry  we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now  hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy      ,1

Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History.Also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard!Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is the Haters say that is not a new Wall but rather a renovation. Wrong and we must build where most needed....Everybody including me thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others) that was the end. But no the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020.

They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America or get back to work....As I have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us!https://t.co/Oe8E5kk8OA....In the meantime my Administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Country‚Äôs history........But they really want a do-over!

2019-05-30,Very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend Senator Thad Cochran. He was a real Senator with incredible values - even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important Healthcare Vote when he was desperately ill. Thad never let our Country (or me) down!....at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.On June 10th the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our Country STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied..The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration or even Fake News - but why not everything else is!Yesterday Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever: 1036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am.

2019-06-11,Maria Dagan Steve Stuart V - When you are the big ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed) Tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and  most importantly a powerful way to get.........Companies to come to the U.S.A and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. We stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to Mexico. If the Tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass. But very happy with the deal I made.......If Mexico produces (which I think they will). Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed! China is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariff. So far little effect to consumer. Companies will relocate to U.S.Today here in Iowa we honor America‚Äôs cherished farming heritage.

Thank you also to Mexico for the work being done on helping with Illegal Immigration - a very big difference!Seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed Country cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important Census in this case for 2020. I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census no matter how long until the..........United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great Country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a Citizen.

2019-07-01,....New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible. So on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!That‚Äôs right The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus with Zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt. Just in case anyone is interested - Clinton Foundation never even looked at!I am excited to announce that @MercedesSchlapp will soon be joining our Campaign. She feels so strongly about our Country &amp; its future. We are setting records in so many ways &amp; we will keep it going. Mercedes has done a fantastic job within the Administration &amp; I am so thankful!It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent &amp; expenses &amp; gave away.......In the meantime our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. No rush but I am sure we will ultimately get there!I will be interviewed by @TuckerCarlson tonight at 8:00pm on @FoxNews!It was great being with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea this weekend. We had a great meeting he looked really well and very healthy - I look forward to seeing him again soon........more money than it had. Going on for years originally brought by Crooked Hillary‚Äôs Campaign Chair A.G. Eric Schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women. They never even looked at the disgusting Clinton Foundation. Now Cuomo‚Äôs A.G. is harassing all of my.........why President Trump has to deal with North Korea the way it is now. He had to figure out what to do with the Korea mess. I think this is why the President deserves a lot of credit.‚Äù Harry Kazianis Center for the National Interest.

While there it was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting. Good things can happen for all!Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state.

2019-07-03,Our Border Patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses. The Democrats bad Immigration Laws which could be easily fixed are the problem. Great job by Border Patrol above and beyond. Many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they..........came from and in far safer conditions. No matter how good things actually look even if perfect the Democrat visitors will act shocked &amp; aghast at how terrible things are. Just Pols. If they really want to fix them change the Immigration Laws and Loopholes. So easy to do!.....Now if you really want to fix the Crisis at the Southern Border both humanitarian and otherwise tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally and hopefully through a system based on Merit. This way we have no problems at all!The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or to state it differently FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question.Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the Border. Thank you Mexico!Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to ‚Äúany amount we want‚Äù if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come. All problems solved!The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes we have the pilots the airport is right next door (Andrews) all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher his wonderful wife Andrea and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!S&amp;P 500 hits new record high. Up 19% for the year. Congratulations!We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world. Not bad!Our July 4th Salute to America at the Lincoln Memorial is looking to be really big. It will be the show of a lifetime!Iran was violating the 150 Billion Dollar (plus 1.8 Billion Dollar in CASH) Nuclear Deal with the United States and others who paid NOTHING long before I became President - and they have now breached their stockpile limit. Not good!A very sad time for America when the Supreme Court of the United States won‚Äôt allow a question of ‚ÄúIs this person a Citizen of the United States?‚Äù to be asked on the #2020 Census!

The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal....We are doing great Economically as a Country Number One despite the Fed‚Äôs antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow!....and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged.

Result of the Mueller Report NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!...https://t.co/GLiV8RGsNjWhen we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border something which cannot do the job the Fake News Media gives us zero credit for building a new Wall. We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling with no poison pills........This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets!Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!....But the questions should be asked why were all of Clinton‚Äôs people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover Lisa Page deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!The ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said ‚ÄúAdvisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.‚Äù Now really does that sound like me? What advisors there were no talking points....The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers &amp; no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly  rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....https://t.co/2lPjfxOKq3Thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the Fake News Media will never do! @SteveHiltonx @NextRevFNC https://t.co/SgRnbsh5pT....Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer he must have seen how dangerous &amp; bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a ‚Äúmanufactured crisis‚Äù as the Fake News Media &amp; their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!With almost no inflation our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition Quantitative Tightening is continuing making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.........as we have done it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower &amp; GDP &amp; our Country‚Äôs wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time &amp; money. Also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down! Very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now. The Fed raised &amp; tightened far too much &amp; too fast. In other words they missed it (Big!). Don‚Äôt miss it again!....except for those stated by me &amp; ‚Äúreams of paper‚Äù were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean &amp; belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel &amp; our Country!https://t.co/1DVvqFQxRK,-0.00809899989037799,-0.00523213571291703,0.00020202706504712786,0.0024564423328945484,-0.256320021268401,408482.0,1814464.0,-0.9988,0.215,0.692,0.092,highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple  in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt  result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction     we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated barrier on the southern border something which cannot do the job the fake news media gives us zero credit for building a new wall  we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls i am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell senate minority leader chuck schumer speaker of the house nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy   on a two year budget and debt ceiling with no poison pills        this was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our great military and vets going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens  leaving now the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false  zero truth  just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do  their economy is dead and will get much worse  iran is a total mess     but the questions should be asked why were all of clinton‚Äôs people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested them(this is illegal) fake news equals the enemy of the people the ‚Äúsquad‚Äù is a very racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart  they are pulling the once great democrat party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the border   and are now against ice and homeland security  so bad for our country the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news  they said ‚Äúadvisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen ‚Äù now really does that sound like me  what advisors there were no talking points    the mainstream media is out of control  they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see  it has never been this bad  they have gone bonkers &amp; no longer care what is right or wrong  this large scale false reporting is sick senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators  this is a great thing  nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally  they wildly  rushed border patrol  some agents were badly injured     you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the fake news media will never do  @stevehiltonx @nextrevfnc  on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous &amp; bad for our country the border is  it is not a ‚Äúmanufactured crisis‚Äù as the fake news media &amp; their democrat partners tried to portray  he said he wants to meet  i will set up a meeting asap with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve  in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete  as good         as we have done it could have been soooo much better  interest rate costs should have been much lower &amp; gdp &amp; our country‚Äôs wealth accumulation much higher  such a waste of time &amp; money  also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down  very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now  the fed raised &amp; tightened far too much &amp; too fast  in other words they missed it (big )  don‚Äôt miss it again     except for those stated by me &amp; ‚Äúreams of paper‚Äù were never given to me  it is a made up story meant to demean &amp; belittle  the post had no sources  the facts remain the same that we have  radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel &amp; our country ,1

Eric Swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews about the phony Witch Hunt. He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO. Fox sure ain‚Äôt what it used to be. Too bad!Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!Budget Deal gives great victories to our Military and Vets keeps out Democrat poison pill riders. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to act ASAP and support this deal.....I got to know him over his many years as Chairman of the Police Athletic League for which he devoted so much time and energy. Bob Morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed!When an old Wall at the Southern Border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete Wall the Media says no new Wall has been built. Fake News! Building lots of Wall!I was saddened to learn of the recent passing of Bob Morgenthau a truly great man! Bob served as a Naval Officer in World War II was an extraordinary US Attorney Manhattan District Attorney and always a warrior for our Country that he loved so dearly........Tariffs Remittance Fees or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good. Big U.S. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.In 2016 I almost won Minnesota. In 2020 because of America hating anti-Semite Rep.

Gee let‚Äôs impeach the President. The ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù (AOC Plus 3) and other Dems suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Steve joined me after I won the primaries but I loved working with him! https://t.co/jRpmdrGYTBOur great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media. Rather than going through months of slander and libel I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people........John has therefore decided to stay in Congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of Texas and our Country. I will be announcing my nomination for DNI shortly.A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week get home ASAP A$AP!....Chariman Kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the United States with me as President can make that vision come true. He will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend President Trump!Kim Jong Un and North Korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days. These missiles tests are not a violation of our signed Singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands. There may be a United Nations violation but.......Chairman Kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for North Korea to gain - the potential as a Country under Kim Jong Un‚Äôs leadership is unlimited. Also there is far too much to lose. I may be wrong but I believe that......Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!THANK YOU OHIO!! #KAG2020 https://t.co/UF6b1sdC4rI would like to thank two Great Iowa Senators @ChuckGrassley and @SenJoniErnst - for their support today on the Spending Bill.

They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi. I will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!Leaving El Paso for the White House. What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton Ohio. The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn‚Äôt work. The love respect &amp; enthusiasm were there for all to see. They have been through so much. Sad!I don‚Äôt know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Joaquin!I don‚Äôt know who Juaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Juaquin!....in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our Federal Reserve.
